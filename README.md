# ZeroLogon testing script

A Python script that uses the Impacket library to test vulnerability for the Zerologon exploit (CVE-2020-1472).

It attempts to perform the Netlogon authentication bypass. The script will immediately terminate when successfully 
performing the bypass, and not perform any Netlogon operations. When a domain controller is patched, the detection 
script will give up after sending 2000 pairs of RPC calls and conclude the target is not vulnerable (with a 
false negative chance of 0.04%).

## Installation

Requires Python 3.7 or higher and Pip. Install dependencies as follows:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Note that running `pip install impacket` should work as well, as long as the script is not broken by future Impacket 
versions.

## Running the script

~~The script targets can be used to target a DC or backup DC. It likely also works against a read-only DC, but this has 
not been tested. Given a domain controller named `EXAMPLE-DC` with IP address `1.2.3.4`, run the script as follows:~~

This script has been modified to support files for domain controller FQDNs and their corresponding IP addresses. An example on how to gather & feed the data into this version is below (also included in the help output):

```
dig -t SRV _gc._tcp.evil.corp +short | cut -d " " -f4 > dc_hostnames.txt
for dc in $(cat dc_hostnames.txt); do dig $dc +short >> dc_ips.txt; done

python3 zerologon_tester.py dc_hostnames.txt dc_ips.txt
```
Example Output:
```
python3 zerologon_tester.py dc_hostnames.txt dc_ips.txt                 
[*] Converting domain controller FQDN to NetBIOS...
[+] Converted domain controller to NetBIOS format!

Checking: DC1 on IP address: 10.0.0.2
Performing authentication attempts...
========================
Success! DC can be fully compromised by a Zerologon attack.

Checking: DC2 on IP address: 10.0.0.4
Performing authentication attempts...
====================================================================================================================================================================================
Success! DC can be fully compromised by a Zerologon attack.
```

The DC name should be its NetBIOS computer name. If this name is not correct, the script will likely fail with a 
`STATUS_INVALID_COMPUTER_NAME` error.
